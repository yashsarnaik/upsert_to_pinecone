# Upsert to Pinecone

This Streamlit app allows you to easily upload PDFs, vectorize their contents, and store the resulting embeddings in a Pinecone database. It includes the following key features:

1.PDF Vectorization: Automatically vectorizes the content of uploaded PDFs using the integrated vectorization pipeline.

2.Pinecone DB Index Management: The app can check if the specified Pinecone index exists. If not, it will create a new one; otherwise, it will upsert the vectorized data to the existing index.

3.Streamlined Workflow: A simple and user-friendly Streamlit interface makes the process of managing Pinecone DB and vectorizing PDFs seamless.
